The data which is used in this project has been taken from the kaggle. The dataset is of USA Housing Dataset which includes 7 columns including target variable "Price". In this task we have to predict the house prices in USA.

The project includes basic EDA, Outlier Analysis, Baseline Model Building, Model Comparison, Sklearn-Pipeline to Avoid Data Leakage, Cross Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning Using Randomsized Search CV & Prediction.
